Opaque first
	- Draw materials that aren't transparent first, then transparent ones after

Opaque front to back
	- Draw materials nearest the camera first. GPU doesn't draw fragments behind something, but this optimises it

Transparent back to front
	- So that see through materials have the correct geometry behind it

Frustrum culling
	- Calculate bounding volume of materials as they're read and don't render if a material is outside the view frustrum

Dynamic near/far plane
	- Fit near and far plane to tightly wrap the materials, helps eliminate Z-fighting
